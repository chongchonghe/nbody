## Description

ASTR615 HW #4: Simulation and Visualization of N-body Problems

## How to run

### Problem 2

Files are in the folders *simulation* and *visual*. 

cd into simulations/ and do

	../pp-nbody/a.out cluster03.txt cluster03 1000 0.01 0.001 200 1

and all the outputs will be in the folder cluster03/.

visual_parallel.py runs in parallel and make plots of all the outputs in a given folder. You need the following packages: mayavi and mpi4py. They are not easy to install. The videos are shown in the folder simulations/cluster03.mp4
