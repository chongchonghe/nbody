- test_small_step_size.mp4: small step sizes (~1/100 of orbital period), 
can resolve binaries.
- test_large_step_size_fig.mp4: large step sizes (100 times larger than 
the previous one), cannot resolve binaries.
- test_merging.mp4: large step sizes, but a binary-merging mechanism is 
added to the code so that binaries are converted to one particle 
representing the center of mass.
