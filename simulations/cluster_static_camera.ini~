; [main]
; scale: scale of particle sizes; depends on the ratio of the masses to the positions 
; distance: the distance of the camera to the center
; phi: camera direction in spherical coordinate
; theta: camera direction in spherical coordinate. 90 is edge-on; 0 is face-on
; resolution: default: 8. Must be [3, 1024]
; focalpoint: the center of the camera view (the center of the system)
; hold: hold on when plotting one figure

; [advanced]: controls rotation of the camera

; [singleview]: view a single output file with camera moving
